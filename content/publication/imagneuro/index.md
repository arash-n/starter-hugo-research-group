abstract: The circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis and clearance, and impairments in its flow can lead to various brain disorders. Recent studies have shown that CSF effective motility can be interrogated using low b-value diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (low-b dMRI). Nevertheless, the spatial organization of intracranial CSF flow dynamics remains largely elusive. Here, we developed a whole-brain voxel-based analysis framework, termed CSF pseudo-diffusion spatial statistics (CPsiSS), to examine CSF mean pseudo-diffusivity (MPsi), a measure of CSF flow magnitude derived from low-b dMRI. We showed that intracranial CSF MPsi demonstrates characteristic covariance patterns by employing seed-based correlation analysis. Next, we applied non-negative matrix factorization analysis to further elucidate the covariance patterns of CSF MPsi in a hypothesis-free, data-driven way. We identified ten distinct CSF compartments with high reproducibility and reliability, reflected by a high mean adjusted Rand index with a low standard deviation (0.82 [SD 0.018]) in split-half analyses of the discovery multimodal aging dataset (n = 187). The identified patterns displayed similar MPsi across three replication datasets. In discovery and replication multimodal aging cohorts (unique n = 264), our study revealed that age, sex, brain atrophy, ventricular anatomy, and cerebral perfusion differentially influence MPsi across these CSF spaces. Notably, of the 35 individuals exhibited anomalous CSF flow patterns, five displayed clinically consequential incidental findings on multimodal neuroradiological examinations, which were not observed in other participants (p = 3.04 x 10-5). Our work sets forth a new paradigm to study CSF flow, with potential applications in clinical settings.
